        question: 'How Does Recovery Work?',
        answer: 'The techniques we use to recover our clients’ accounts vary widely from case to case. In the event of a password recovery we will walk our clients through extracting an encrypted private key backup and building a comprehensive list of possible password guesses. We then transfer our client’s data to secure password cracking servers that use the data collected from the client to try billions or trillions of possible password combinations until the correct password is found',
    },
    {
        question: 'How long does the process take?',
        answer: 'The process of recovering lost crypto can vary in time from as short as 1 hour, to as long as 6+ months. While this may sound lengthy, this is because we typically exhaust our initial search within a week after initially onboarding a client. After this initial search has been exhausted, we hold on to the private key backup and password guesses to continue retesting as we discover new recovery vectors and expand our hardware capabilities (unless otherwise requested to delete client information).',
